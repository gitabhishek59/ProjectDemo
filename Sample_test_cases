Here's how you can structure the test cases for both functions:

    Test cases for one_to_one_match:
        Test when there is a single matching invoice row for each transaction row.
        Test when there is no matching invoice row for any transaction row.
        Test when there are multiple matching invoice rows for each transaction row.
        Test with empty transaction file.
        Test with empty invoice file.
        Test with invalid input data (e.g., incorrect column names or data types).

    Test cases for one_to_many_match:
        Test when there are multiple matching invoice rows for each transaction row.
        Test when there is no matching invoice row for any transaction row.
        Test with empty transaction file.
        Test with empty invoice file.
        Test with invalid input data (e.g., incorrect column names or data types).

Remember that these are just example test cases, and you should adapt them based on the specific requirements and behavior of your Python Engine.
